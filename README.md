# Proton VPN Core API

The `proton-vpn-core-api` acts as a facade to the other Proton VPN components,
exposing a uniform API to the available Proton VPN services. 

## Development

Even though our CI pipelines always test and build releases using Linux
distribution packages, you can use pip to set up your development environment.

### Proton package registry

If you didn't do it yet, to be able to pip install Proton VPN components you'll
need to set up our internal Python package registry. You can do so running the
command below, after replacing `{GITLAB_TOKEN`} with your
[personal access token](https://gitlab.protontech.ch/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md)
with the scope set to `api`.

```shell
pip config set global.index-url https://__token__:{GITLAB_TOKEN}@gitlab.protontech.ch/api/v4/groups/777/-/packages/pypi/simple
```

In the index URL above, `777` is the id of the current root GitLab group,
the one containing the repositories of all our Proton VPN components.

### Virtual environment

You can create the virtual environment and install the rest of dependencies as
follows:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tests

You can run the tests with:

```shell
pytest
```
